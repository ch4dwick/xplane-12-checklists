# xplane-12-checklists

My Personal Checklists for X-Plane 12 Planes I have studied.

# How to use

First, you need [Xchecklist](https://github.com/sparker256/xchecklist) installed in X-Plane. Copy the plane's checklist file from this repository to the target plane's root folder.

e.g. copy CitationX.txt to \<your x-plane installation folder>\Aircraft\Laminar Research\Cessna Citation X and rename to clist.txt.

The checklist will show up on your next flight. If it doesn't, open Xchecklist's plugin menu and select Open Checklist.
